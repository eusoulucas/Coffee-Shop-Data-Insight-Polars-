This repository contains notebooks and data for a data analysis project. The data folder contains the datasets used for the analysis.

## etl.ipynb
- Notebook contains code for extracting, transforming, and loading data from different sources into a format suitable for analysis.
## analysis.ipynb *(Working in progress)*
- Notebook contains the main analysis code. It uses Pandas and other data analysis libraries to explore the datasets, visualize the data, and draw insights from it.
## outlier.ipynb *(Working in progress)*
- Notebook contains code for identifying and handling outliers in the data.

### Feel free to explore the notebooks and datasets in this repository to learn more about the data analysis project.
